Because of the wide variety of possible flow measurements (commodities, aggregation type), the model adopts a thin approach, which may result in many records being returned for a single well.

This schema is a view of GeoSciML data that denormalizes the data and concatenates complex property values into single, human-readable, labels and returns single, representative values from controlled vocabularies for multi-valued properties that can be used when generating thematic maps, or portrayals, of the data. It is separate to, but harmonized with, GeoSciML and conforms to the level 0 of the Simple Features Profile for GML (link). Labels will be 'free-text' fields that will be, in robust services, well-structured summaries of complex GeoSciML data, while the representative thematic properties will be URIs of concepts in a controlled vocabulary. There may also be links, via identifier URIs, to full GeoSciML representations of the geologic features. The geologic unit feature content also conforms closely to the content in the USGS-AASG NCGMP09 database design for a description of map units. These features are essentially geographically located descriptions of outcrop to map scale units of rock--including lithologic composition, age, internal structure (bedding, foliation etc.) and genesis. The content model might be associated with map units on a geologic map, individual polygons (on a map) or borehole intervals (in a stratigraphic log), or with point locations to describe outcrops in field data.
